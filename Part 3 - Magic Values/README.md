# Part 3 - "Magic Values"

In this part, we will look at the use of "magic strings" and "magic numbers" (collectively referred to as "magic values") in XAML files. "Magic values" can make code harder to understand and often mean changes need to be made in more than one place. As such, it's wise to avoid them whenever possible and so we'll look at ways of doing this.

The code examples in this part will continue on from the previous part. If you have the solution open, you can carry on from there. Alternatively, open the [solution in the Start directory](./Start/).

## Outline

[[Part introduction]]

In this part, we'll look at:

<<
- reused names (or color values)
