# Part 4 - Naming

In this part, we will look at the names we give to the elements and resources we use in XAML files. We'll look at how to use names that help with code maintainability and by making it easier to read and understand. We'll then extend these principles to see how to create semantically meaningful files.

The code examples in this part will continue on from the previous part. If you have the solution open, you can carry on from there. Alternatively, open the [solution in the Start directory](./Start/).
