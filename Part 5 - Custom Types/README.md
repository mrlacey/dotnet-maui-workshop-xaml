# Part 5 - Custom Types

In this part, we will create and use more custom types in our XAML files. These will be more sophisticated than the simple types we used in the last part but they are not something to be feared or avoided.

The code examples in this part will continue on from the previous part. If you have the solution open, you can carry on from there. Alternatively, open the [solution in the Start directory](./Start/).
