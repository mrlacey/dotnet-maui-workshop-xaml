# .NET MAUI - Workshop: Focus on XAML

Today, we will take the app you created in the [.NET MAUI Workshop](https://github.com/mrlacey/dotnet-maui-workshop) and focus on improving the XAML.

While the XAML you created as part of that workshop is functional, there are many opportunities to make it better.

Many people criticize XAML as being verbose and hard to maintain. By completing this workshop, you'll see how that doesn't have to be the case and that it is possible to create XAML that is easy to write, read, understand, and maintain.

While this workshop exclusively focuses on .NET MAUI, the principles can be applied to any use of XAML files, whether that be WPF, UWP, WinUI, [Avalonia](https://www.avaloniaui.net/), [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/), or something else.

## Setup

This workshop is a direct follow-up to the [.NET MAUI Workshop](https://github.com/mrlacey/dotnet-maui-workshop). After you've completed that workshop, you'll be all set to do this one.  
You can follow their [setup guide](https://github.com/mrlacey/dotnet-maui-workshop/blob/main/README.md#setup-guide) if you're coming straight to this workshop.

## Agenda

This workshop has the following parts:

* [Part 0](Part%200%20-%20Overview/README.md) - Overview
* [Part 1](Part%201%20-%20Fundamentals/README.md) - Fundamentals
* [Part 2](Part%202%20-%20Responsibility/README.md) - Responsibility
* [Part 3](Part%203%20-%20Magic%20Values/README.md) - Magic Values
* [Part 4](Part%204%20-%20Naming/README.md) - Naming
* [Part 5](Part%205%20-%20Custom%20Types/README.md) - Custom Types

In each folder for parts 1 to 5, you'll find a **README.md** file with directions for that part, along with folders containing the code at the `Start` and `End` of the part.

But before that, let's [get started with Part 0](Part%200%20-%20Overview/README.md).

## More links and resources

There are very few people striving to improve the experience of working with XAML.
