# Part 1 - Fundamentals

In this part, we're going to look at the fundamentals of a good code base regardless of programming language and apply them to XAML. We're not going to cover the fundamentals of XAML as a language as there are many other resources covering this topic.



While the last part was entirely theoretical, we're now ready


open solution if haven't already


this might seem simple but it's important to get the fundamentals right
these things might seem trivial but most developers don't do this - and so suffer.
if you do already do this, congratulations--you're awesome--enjoy a moment of smugness, but don't think there's nothing else for you to learn in this workshop, we may be starting oof slowly but things will get more advanced soon.

## Consistency

A tidy code base is a happy code base


if it's a mess, how do you find what you're looking for


inconsistencies are distracting and make it harder to read.


and harder to review well
