# Part 2 - Responsibility

In this part, we will look at the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and how it can be applied to XAML. You don't need any prior knowledge of this principle to complete this part.

The code examples in this part will continue on from the previous part. If you have the solution open, you can carry on from there. Alternatively, open the [solution in the Start directory](./Start/).
